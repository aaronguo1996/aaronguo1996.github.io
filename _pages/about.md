I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.ucsd.edu) department at the [University of California, San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu). I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Nadia Polikarpova](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~npolikarpova), and be a member of [Programming Systems group](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys). Before Ph.D., I earned my master's degree in computer science from UCSD and bachelor's degree in software engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn).

I am interested in using programming language and machine learning techniques to automate programming tasks. My research aims to simplify the software development process for engineers, including program generation, optimization, and migration.

**Research interests**: program synthesis, program optimization, artificial intelligence, compilers
